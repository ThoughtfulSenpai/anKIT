# Details
**Collection of personal scripts, card templates and gists for anki** that I've put together from different sources and/or written myself. Most of these are scripts I found online and decided to tinker to fit my needs. Therefore, feel free to tinker these to **your** needs too.

## Overview
### Templates for language learning.
1. Template for Japanese **Vocabulary** cards.

3. Template for Japanese **"unscramble the sentence"** cards.
4. Templates for JLPT style exercises. (including the ones with the dreaded :tw-2b50:)
